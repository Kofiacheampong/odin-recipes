    <p>Goat curry is a spicy and flavorful dish that is popular in many parts
         of the world, particularly in Indian and Caribbean cuisine.
          The dish is made by cooking goat meat with a variety of aromatic 
          spices, such as cumin, coriander, and turmeric, along with onions, 
          garlic, and tomatoes. The resulting curry is rich and hearty, with 
          tender chunks of meat that are bursting with flavor. 
        Serve with rice or flatbread for a delicious and satisfying meal.</p>
